# Final Project: Choose your own adventure
#### CPH 200A Project 3
#### Report Due Date: 7PM PST Dec 2, 2025

## Introduction
Building on the skills you developed in the class, in this project you (in teams of 1 or 2 students) will have the opportunity to apply the skills you have learned to a new problem of your choosing. The goal of this project is to give you experience posing meaningful CPH questions, prototype computational solutions and performing rigorous evaluations to motivate new CPH interventions. Note, these projects do not have to be in cancer but they should draw from the clinical knowledge you picked up in the class. The goal is not a fully functioning solution (though that would be nice), but instead a prototype or a first sketch, of what could later become a full research paper later. At the end of this project, you will present to the class, motivating your research question, introducing related work, describing your approach, your analyses and discussing their implications.  Submit your presentation slides by the due date. You will give a short talk (12min + 3min QA) about your projects during the last day of class.


### Suggested Datasets
While this project truly is **choose your adventure**, you may find of these datasets (in addition to the data from projects 1 and 2) to be useful starting points for your projects.
- [UCSF InfoCommons](https://informationcommons.ucsf.edu/)
  - This contains a large volume ~20k of breast MRIs, all radiology reports, pathology reports, and the EMR.
- [PI-CAI](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/)
- [NCI Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
  - Contains large resources across a range of cancer types and modalities (including pathology slides)
- [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
    - Contains large resources across a range of cancer types and modalities including radiology and pathology
